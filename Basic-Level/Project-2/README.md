## 📌 Project Overview
---
Before starting this project, we successfully completed **Project-1**, where we deployed a basic web server and containerized the application using Docker.
If you haven’t explored it yet, you can find it here:

---
That project laid the **foundation of application deployment and containerization**, which is essential before moving into real-world architectures.

## 🚀 Project-2: LAMP Stack WordPress Deployment

In this second project, we move one step closer to **real-world DevOps practices** by deploying a **LAMP stack (Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP)**–based **WordPress application**.

The main intention of this project is to help you understand **how the same application behaves and is deployed across different platforms and environments**, following a progressive and practical approach.

### Deployment Stages

We will deploy the WordPress application in the following stages:

1. **Localhost / Server-based deployment**

   * Understand traditional deployment fundamentals
   * Learn how application components interact at the OS level

2. **Docker-based deployment**

   * Containerize the WordPress application
   * Run and manage services using containers

3. **Kubernetes (K8s) cluster deployment**

   * Deploy the same application in a Kubernetes environment
   * Learn scalability, service management, and orchestration concepts

Each stage builds on the previous one, reinforcing the idea that **tools change, but deployment principles remain the same**.

## 🧰 Technology Stack Used

During this project, we will work with and understand the role of the following technologies:

* **Linux** – Base operating system and server fundamentals
* **Docker** – Application containerization
* **Kubernetes (K8s)** – Container orchestration and cluster deployment
* **Argo CD** – GitOps-based continuous deployment
* **Monitoring Stack**

  * Prometheus
  * Grafana
  * Exporters

The goal is not just to use these tools, but to understand **why and where** they fit in real DevOps workflows.

## Learning Objective

By completing this project, you should be able to:

* Understand **2-tier and 3-tier application deployment concepts**
* Deploy the same application across **multiple platforms**
* Gain confidence in **real-world DevOps project execution**
* Build a strong, job-ready **DevOps project portfolio**

---

This project is designed to **teach mindset first, tools second**—exactly how real DevOps engineers work.
